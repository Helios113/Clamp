# Clamp
1.5" dovetail clamp I made up after watching AVE's video.
To make it work just tap the two M10 holes and crank away!
The two M10 bolts act as pushrods and deform the structure in order to generate clamping.
The maximum clamping provided depends on the torque applied.
Tighten the bolts before you put it in the vise.

Feel free to play with the model as much as you like.
